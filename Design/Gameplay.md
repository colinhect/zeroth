# Gameplay

Zeroth is a non-traditional single player space simulator exploring the nature of reality and mind.

# Player

The player controls semi-organic life technology referred to as `Zeroth`.  The interface of the player to the game acts as a depiction of what the nature of concious experience is like for `Zeroth`.  This specific nature is ambiguously non-dual and fractal (as above, so below) allowing for the player to control single entities, individual pieces of enities, or collective groups of entities, always presented as being experienced as a single conciousness. 

The player starts a new game as a `Selector` which is migrating entity traveling faster than light to select a location in all of space to spawn in.  It is highly agile and able to navigate effectively between galaxies, within galaxies between star systems, and within star systems.  It has complex sensing abilities allowing for multiple modes of experience to allow for easy selection of interesting parts of space.

`Selectors` are not invinsible and do not have infinite energy.
