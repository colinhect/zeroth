# Gameplay

Zeroth is a non-traditional single player space simulator exploring the nature of reality and mind.

# Player

The player controls semi-organic life technology referred to as `Zeroth`.  The interface of the player to the game acts as a depiction of what the nature of concious experience is like for `Zeroth`.  This specific nature is fractal, allowing for the player to control single entities, individual pieces of enities, or collective groups of entities, always presented as being experienced as a single conciousness.  Even through exotic forms of life can emerge during some modes of game play, a large amount of game play will be as a humanoid or in the 'qualia cockpit' of a ship.  Ships c

The game begins with the player at a point of interest in space or on in a surface of a planet.  The player will start as a singular entity (humanoid, ship, surface vehicle, etc) and will eventually build a network of a super organism, which allows new gameplay at higher levels of scale.

The player starts a new game as a `Selector` which is migrating entity traveling faster than light to select a location in all of space to spawn in.  It is highly agile and able to navigate effectively between galaxies, within galaxies between star systems, and within star systems.  It has complex sensing abilities allowing for multiple modes of experience to allow for easy selection of interesting parts of space.

`Selectors` are not invinsible and do not have infinite energy.
